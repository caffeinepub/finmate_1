  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements with good fidelity. REQ-1 (Home wallet card), REQ-2 (Profile wallet card), REQ-3 (WalletQRModal with client-side QR), REQ-4 (walletBalance in backend), and REQ-5 (walletBalance exposed via useQueries) are all present. The QR code is generated via a custom pure-TypeScript library rather than qrcode.react, which still satisfies the client-side constraint. A ScanPayModal is integrated for the Send action which was not requested. A migration module was added as a bonus.",
