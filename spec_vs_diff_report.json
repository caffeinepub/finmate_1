  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by adding a PIN confirmation modal gate to the 'Check Balance' quick-action button on the Home page. The implementation uses PinConfirmationModal with biometric/fingerprint support, reveals balance only after successful authentication, hides balance on cancellation/failure, and includes a 30-second auto-hide timer. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
